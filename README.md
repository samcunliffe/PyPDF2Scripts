pyPdf2Scripts
=============

Just a load of scripts to do things to pdfs that I often want to do.
Particularly useful on the HEP machines where we don't have pdftk.

Prerequisites
-------------
python > 2.7 ( I use argparse )

Includes pyPDF2 as a submodule. 
If you don't want this, then you need to have an install of [pyPDF2](http://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2) in your `PYTHONPATH`.
